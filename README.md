## About Me

I'm Gonzalo Molina, an organized, proactive, and communicative individual with a knack for building strong relationships. I have a proven track record of efficiently managing time and priorities in previous projects, successfully achieving objectives. I possess the ability to quickly grasp new technologies and solidify them through practical application. I'm excited to learn and gain experience in this field.

I delved into the world of programming and thanks to Plataforma5, I acquired knowledge that initially seemed complex to me. Currently, I'm working on full-stack applications using technologies such as JavaScript, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, React, Redux, Bootstrap, and Chakra, among others. While I still have much to learn, I thoroughly enjoy the continuous process of acquiring new information and I'm eager to explore additional technologies to expand my skill set.

I thrive in teamwork environments, as I believe that learning and enjoyment are heightened when collaborating with others. During my experience at Plataforma5, I had the opportunity to work on projects with diverse teammates, and I discovered that effective communication and empathy were key to establishing connections and achieving successful outcomes.

I'm truly excited to embark on my professional journey in the programming field and continue growing. The idea of tackling new challenges and constantly improving my skills while contributing to innovative projects motivates me. I am ready to seize opportunities as they arise and build a successful career in this thrilling industry.
